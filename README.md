The goal of this project is to learn to use Selenium to automate applying for jobs. 
Thus, by the end of today, you should have a program that can use LinkedIn's "Easy Apply" function to send applications to all the jobs that meet your criteria (instead of just a single listing).

Since there are few reservations about sending job applications to the job listings on LinkedIn, this code only follow the company that posted the job instead.
